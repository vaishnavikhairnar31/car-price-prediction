# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – Full-Stack Machine Learning Application

This project is a **full-stack machine learning application** that predicts the **selling price of second-hand cars** using real-world features such as year of purchase, fuel type, transmission, number of owners, and kilometers driven.

I built this project **end-to-end** to understand how a machine learning model is **trained, deployed as an API, and consumed by a frontend application** in a real-world setup.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Determining the correct price of a used car is challenging because many factors influence its value.  
This application provides a **data-driven price estimation** using historical car data and machine learning.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project consists of **three main components**:

### 1️⃣ Machine Learning Layer
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** using Scikit-learn  
- Performed data preprocessing and one-hot encoding  
- Serialized the trained model for real-time predictions  

### 2️⃣ Backend – FastAPI
- Developed a REST API using **FastAPI**  
- Used **Pydantic** for request validation and type safety  
- Loaded the trained model and performed inference on incoming data  

### 3️⃣ Frontend – Streamlit
- Built an interactive UI using **Streamlit**  
- Collected user inputs and sent them to the backend API  
- Displayed predicted car prices instantly
